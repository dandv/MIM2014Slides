    "body": "So famous surfaces do not allow normal browser scroll by default. Currently the `atForm` is not usable on a mobile if you include lots of login options. While a scroll view would work I find its not only overkill but has a very different feel then the default scroll settings. \r\n\r\nMy solution (inspired by https://famous-views.meteor.com/ source code):\r\n```css\r\n.scrollable {\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  overflow-y: scroll;\r\n  overflow-x: hidden;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will provide a 'normal' scroll for the user. \r\n\r\nNow I don't feel this should be added directly as other users will want to take different approaches. What I would like is some way to add css classes in line:\r\n```handlebars\r\n{{> atForm class='scrollable'}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is likely a core package issue but you may want to go a different route.\r\n\r\n"
